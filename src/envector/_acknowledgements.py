"""
The `envector package <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/envector/>`_ for
`Python <https://www.python.org/>`_ is based on the `nvector package
<http://pypi.python.org/pypi/nvector/>`_ . The original package
was written by Per A. Brodtkorb at
`FFI (The Norwegian Defence Research Establishment) <http://www.ffi.no/en>`_
based on the `nvector toolbox <http://www.navlab.net/nvector/#download>`_ for
`Matlab <http://www.mathworks.com>`_ written by the navigation group at
`FFI <http://www.ffi.no/en>`_. The nvector.core and nvector.rotation module is a
vectorized reimplementation of the matlab nvector toolbox while the nvector.objects
module is a new easy to use object oriented user interface to the nvector core
functionality documented in :cite:`GadeAndBrodtkorb2020Nvector`.

Most of the content is based on the article by K. Gade :cite:`Gade2010Nonsingular`.

Thus this article should be cited in publications using this page or
downloaded program code.

However, if you use any of the FrameE.direct, FrameE.inverse,
GeoPoint.distance_and_azimuth or GeoPoint.displace methods you should also cite
the article by Karney :cite:`Karney2013Algorithms` because these methods call
Karney's `geographiclib <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/geographiclib>`_ library
to do the calculations.
