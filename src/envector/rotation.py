def E_rotation(axes: str='e') -> ndarray:
    """
    Returns rotation matrix R_Ee defining the axes of the coordinate frame E.

    Parameters
    ----------
    axes : str
        Either 'e' or 'E'. Defines orientation of the axes of the coordinate frame E.
        If axes is 'e' then z-axis points to the North Pole along the Earth's
        rotation axis, x-axis points towards the point where latitude = longitude = 0.
        If axes is 'E' then x-axis points to the North Pole along the Earth's
        rotation axis, y-axis points towards where longitude +90deg (east) and latitude = 0.

    Returns
    -------
    ndarray
        3 x 3 array rotation matrix defining the axes of the coordinate frame E as
        described in Table 2 in Gade (2010).

    Notes
    -----
    R_Ee controls the axes of the coordinate frame E (Earth-Centred,
    Earth-Fixed, ECEF) used by the other functions in this library.
    It is very common in many fields to choose axes equal to 'e', which
    is also the default in this library. Previously the old matlab toolbox
    the default value was equal to 'E'.
    If you choose axes equal to 'E' the yz-plane coincides with the equatorial
    plane. This choice of axis ensures that at zero latitude and longitude,
    frame N (North-East-Down) has the same orientation as frame E. If
    roll/pitch/yaw are zero, also frame B (forward-starboard-down) has this
    orientation. In this manner, the axes of frame E is chosen to correspond
    with the axes of frame N and B.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> import numpy as np
    >>> import envector as nv
    >>> np.allclose(nv.E_rotation(axes='e'), [[ 0,  0,  1],

    Returns the Euler angles in the xyz-order from a rotation matrix.

    Parameters
    ----------
    R_AB: 3 x 3 x n array
        rotation matrix [no unit] (direction cosine matrix) such that the
        relation between a vector v decomposed in A and B is given by:

        Angles [rad] of rotation about new axes.

    Notes
    -----
    The x, y, z angles are called Euler angles or Tait-Bryan angles and are
    defined by the following procedure of successive rotations:
    Given two arbitrary coordinate frames A and B. Consider a temporary frame
    T that initially coincides with A. In order to make T align with B, we
    first rotate T an angle x about its x-axis (common axis for both A and T).
    Secondly, T is rotated an angle y about the NEW y-axis of T. Finally, T
    is rotated an angle z about its NEWEST z-axis. The final orientation of
    T now coincides with the orientation of B.

    The signs of the angles are given by the directions of the axes and the
    right hand rule.

    R_EL: 3 x 3 x n array
        The resulting rotation matrix.       [no unit]

    Notes
    -----
    Calculates the rotation matrix (direction cosine matrix) R_EL using
    n-vector (n_E) and the wander azimuth angle. When wander_azimuth=0, we
    have that N=L. (See Table 2 in Gade (2010) for details)
